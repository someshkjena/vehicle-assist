				<span>ABOUT</span>
				<p align="left">Roadside assistance coverage helps drivers when their vehicle breaks down. It is an option on almost every auto insurance policy. Your car insurance company typically partners with an existing network of businesses that provide roadside assistance services, or employs a team to contact and arrange service on their customer’s behalf. Which service provider is sent to a driver depends entirely on their location, vehicle, and circumstances.</p><p> The closest and most appropriate service providers tend to be dispatched. Generally, adding roadside assistance to your policy will get you: towing, battery service, flat tire service, fuel delivery, lockout service, and extrication. Below is description of what each service includes and a scenario that would call for it.</p>
